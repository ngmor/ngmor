### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nick Morales.

I graduated from Purdue University in 2019 with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and minors in Electrical & Computer Engineering and Spanish. After graduating I spent 3 years consulting in the industrial automation space for [DMC, Inc](https://www.dmcinfo.com/). During my time with DMC, I architected and wrote controls software for several high-profile clients in sectors including electric car/battery manufacturing, high speed transportation, cell therapy manufacturing, metalworking, and more.

My passion to continue working with cutting edge technologies in the software, electrical, and mechanical realms led me to pursue a [Masterâ€™s in Robotics at Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/robotics/). While at Northwestern, I worked with a miriad of robotic technologies, including [robotic manipulation](https://ngmor.github.io/projects/attack-of-the-franka/), [SLAM](https://ngmor.github.io/projects/ekf-slam-from-scratch/), [autonomous navigation](https://ngmor.github.io/projects/legged-autonomous-inspection/), and [machine learning](https://ngmor.github.io/projects/diffusion-policy-assistive-action-prediction/). I graduated with my M.S. in Robotics in December 2023.
